The project consists of a Login Page and a Student Management Window implemented in Python with the Tkinter library for the GUI.This interface prompts users to enter their credentials (username and password) and verify their access. The login function checks whether the entered credentials match predefined values.
When the login is successful, the user is redirected to the studentmanage.py module, which opens a Student Management Window. This new window allows authorized users to manage student records effectively. The features in the student management interface enable various operations, such as adding, updating, and viewing student data.
